# Unthink Stack and CLI

The Unthink Stack is a specialized web stack built on top of Express with both
the server and client code written in TypeScript. For more information on the
stack see its [documentation](unthink-stack.md).

The Unthink CLI is a tool to make creating and working in projects utilizing
the Unthink Stack easier.

This is the documentation for both.
